The morning briefing is a full stack news scraping app that incorporates MongoDB, Node, Mongoose, Express, and Handelbars to pull articles from the New York Times and dynamically display them on the page. Users can then make comments and notes on those articles which are saved into the Database and can be deleted at a later time.
